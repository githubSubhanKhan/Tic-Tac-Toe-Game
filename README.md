# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
<h2>Description:</h2>
In this Tic Tac Toe game, we've combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an engaging and user-friendly experience. The game interface is designed with a clean and modern layout, ensuring easy navigation and visibility of the game board.
<br>
The core game logic is implemented in JavaScript, ensuring smooth and responsive gameplay. Players can take turns clicking on the grid cells to make their moves, and the game checks for a winner after each move. Upon a winning move, a celebratory message is displayed with an accompanying audio effect, enhancing the overall gaming experience.
